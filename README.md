# Unity Music App
The Unity Music Application is created and built on Unity. It allows users to interact with a virtual instrument setup and play notes for the respective instrument. This application is used as a way to learn the basics of Unity and understand UI elements.

## User Stories
- This application will allow users to mimic playing an instrument. 
- This application will allow the user to interact with different instruments.

## Explanation of the Application
The application currently has two instruments, the piano and a basic drum kit. As seen in the screenshot below the two instruments are to be selected from the main menu.
